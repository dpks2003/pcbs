PICO NEO Development Board

This board provides an easy-to-solder all-throughole 10cm x 10cm 2-layer board which is used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi Pico for basic, fun experimentation!


Features include:

Three general purpose buttons and a reset button,
Two general purpose LEDs and a power LED,
An I2C SSD1306 Screen,
An I2C AT24 EEPROM
An LDR for Analog experimentation,
And a bunch more expansion ports, two of which are arranged to work with cheap SD card and accelerometer modules!
